        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I'm a dedicated web developer with over 2 years of experience in front-end development. My journey began with a fascination for how websites work, which led me to dive deep into web technologies and user experience design.</p>

            <li>HTML5 & CSS3</li>
            <li>JavaScript (ES6+)</li>
            <li>React.js</li>
